# Microfluidics-based-Liver-Function-Monitor
This is the repository for my final year B.Tech Project at IIT Guwahati. 

A proof-of-concept standalone point of care device was developed for liver function tests. The absorbance of specific proteins is measured in a microfluidic array and the concentration calculated and displayed on a display. The device may be powered by a mobile charger or a power bank.
